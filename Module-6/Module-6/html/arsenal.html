      <div class="text">Classic</div>
      <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Classic is a pistol that all players receive upon spawning. It has two firing modes, a standard semi-automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic shotgun alternate fire that fires three bullets instantly but only at around a third of its usual fire rate.</p>

      <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Shorty is the cheapest purchasable weapon in the game. As a sidearm equivalent of a shotgun, it is most effective at short range to instantly take an enemy by surprise. With good damage and functionality despite its low price tag, it can even be used to catch out a fully-bought enemy in eco rounds, allowing the player to gain a powerful weapon upgrade for very little investment.</p>

      <div class="text">Frenzy</div>
      <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Frenzy is a low-cost automatic pistol. As a sidearm equivalent of an SMG, it's not too punishing to use on the move at short ranges, making it most effective at that range and the best sidearm to use in such scenarios, though to challenge enemies who have full-bought getting headshots will most likely be necessary.</p>

        <div class="text">Sheriff</div>
        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Sheriff is a semi-automatic revolver and the most expensive sidearm in the game. Able to kill enemies with a single bullet to the head at most ranges and health totals, it can be used to challenge even enemies who have full-bought. It's high penetration and extra reserve magazine also makes it useful for spamming for wallbangs during pistol or eco rounds. With a low-capacity magazine and low fire rate however, even one missed shot can end up being punishing. The Sheriff's high recoil and spread also promotes exceptional control and precision in order to use it when fighting multiple enemies.</p>

It has two firing modes, a standard automatic single-bullet primary fire and a semi-automatic burst-mode alternate fire that fires four bullets in a burst at around an eighth of its usual fire rate. Alternate fire also increases the distance that falloff damage begins to occur at.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Bucky is a low-cost shotgun and the cheapest primary weapon in the game. It has two firing modes, a standard single-shell primary fire and a canister alternate fire that allows the shell to travel a short distance before spraying its pellets instead of immediately spraying from the barrel of the gun, allowing the user to deal some damage to targets at medium range. Shells shot using Alternate Fire only produce a reduced amount of pellets however, and enemies hit by the canister before it reaches the required distance to explode will only take 1 pellet worth of damage.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Judge is a moderately-priced automatic shotgun. It is best used in situations that put the user in close range against multiple enemies, being able to wipe them out quickly should they risk not clearing such small areas beforehand. As with all shotguns, the Judge has pellet spread that can be reduced by crouching, though the spread still makes it effectively useless at long ranges no matter what. Unlike the other shotguns however, the Judge does not have a distance cap on its pellets and can hit enemies beyond 50 meters.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
    <p class="toggleText">The Guardian is a moderately-priced semi-automatic rifle. It is most effective in long-range fights in the hands of players who are confident in their ability to hit headshots at such distances, being more accurate than a Vandal. The Guardian's high penetration also makes it useful for getting wallbang kills. In short to medium range fights however, the Guardian cannot compete with the Phantom or Vandal due to their higher rates of fire.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Phantom is a high-cost automatic rifle. One of VALORANT's best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at short to medium range where it is able to spray down multiple enemies at once due to its high rate of fire. It also comes equipped with a silencer, allowing it to be used to spam through vision blockers without much risk to the player's ammo count or positioning.</p>

      <p class="toggleText">The Vandal is a high-cost automatic rifle. One of VALORANT's best general-purpose weapons, it is most effective at picking off individual targets at longer ranges due to having no falloff, allowing it to kill any enemy with a single headshot at all ranges.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Marshal is a low cost sniper rifle. As a sniper, it has a scope with a single zoom setting on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still. Despite sniper rifles usually being extremely inaccurate when used in Primary Fire mode, the Marshal is surprisingly accurate in this case, meaning it can be used to take on multiple enemies at once so long as the user can hit their shots.</p>

      <p class="toggleText">The Operator is a high-cost sniper rifle and the most expensive gun in the game. As a sniper, it has a scope with two zoom settings on its Alternate Fire mode that has perfect accuracy when standing still.

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Ares is a medium-cost machine gun. Unlike most other guns that gets less accurate as you continuously fire more bullets from them, the Ares is the only gun in the game that gets more accurate as it is continuously fired. As a machine gun, it is most effective as either a defensive tool to hold a site or when used to get wallbang kills due to its high penetration, rate of fire, and magazine capacity. Their lower mobility and higher equip speeds however make them less suited for peeking or entering sites, something better served at such a price by SMGs.</p>

        <input class="button1" type="button" value="Click me">
      <p class="toggleText">The Odin is a high-cost machine gun. When using Primary Fire, the Odin's fire rate will increase over the duration the weapon is fired to a maximum amount, but using Alternate Fire will allow the user to shoot at that maximum fire rate immediately.</p>
